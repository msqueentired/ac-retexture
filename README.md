# Animal Crossing Retexture Files

This repository contains the Inkscape SVG Files for (most) of my contributions to the Animal Crossing Retexture project.

<sub><sup>Note: My contributions are credited under the username *HeyItsDeity*.</sub></sup>

This repository contains *only* my redraws - the original texture files are not included; dump them  yourself, because I can't (and won't) redistribute them.

## Miscellaneous Information

* `girl_bba/`
  * My version is likely not the one used in the main releases.
  * I've included `palette.xml`, which is a file used by my script [SVGBatch](https://github.com/msqueentired/svgbatch) to automate creation of the skintone variants.
* `gyroid/`
  * The only perceivable difference between gyroid variants is gender, so a wildcard (`$`) is used to make Dolphin ignore minor texture hash changes and use only two sets of textures.
